![DIQA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b8fa088-8c0b-4590-a61c-6adfa556452e)

Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) evaluates the suitability of digitized documents for subsequent processing. It looks for things like blurriness, stains, and uneven lighting that can make it hard to read. This is crucial for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) because OCR software works much better with clear images. Poor quality images lead to more mistakes in OCR, wasting time and money. DIQA helps by identifying bad images beforehand, allowing for improvement (like sharpening or brightening) or flagging them for manual review, ensuring more accurate and efficient OCR results.


This research utilized the [SmartDoc QA dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/5293201), comprising smartphone-captured document images with ground truth text annotations. The pipeline was developed as a practical application of various ML engineering tools and best practices, including:

* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Apache Airflow
* **API Serving:** FastAPI
* **Version Control & Reproducibility:** DVC (Data Version Control)
* **Experiment Management:** MLflow
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus
* **Visualization:** Grafana
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Storage:** Amazon S3

## Running in docker
* docker compose up --build

* Run airflow DAGs on http://localhost:8080
  - Trigger diqa_load_data to download SmartDoc dataset and get features
  - Trigger diqa_train to train a model
  - Trigger diqa_predict to predict quality score
* Predict with FastAPI on http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
* Run model selection [here](https://github.com/mary-el/ocr_diqa/blob/master/notebooks/model_selection.ipynb) and look at the results at http://127.0.0.1:600 
* Look at metrics with Prometheus on http://localhost:9090
* Visualize them with Grafana on http://localhost:1234
* Reproduce a DVC pipeline with *dvc repro* and push it to s3 storage with *dvc push*

## Results
Pearson's Linear correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. If there is a strong linear relationship, the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or âˆ’1, and 0 means no linear relationship.
